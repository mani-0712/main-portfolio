      <p>
        Iâ€™m Manikanta, a 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student with a passion for teaching and coding. 
        I specialize in React and front-end development, helping students build real-world projects and 
        master modern web technologies. I am also working on building an AI-based virtual assistant project 
        designed to make daily tasks smarter and easier. Outside of coding, I enjoy continuous learning, 
        working on innovative projects, and inspiring others to achieve their goals.
